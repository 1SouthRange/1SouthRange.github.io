We are Katie, Rafael, and Hushpuppy. We live in a renovated 1977 Airstream
Landyacht Overlander in New Orleans, Louisiana. This has been a labor of
love since October 2016, and we hope to share it with everyone around us,
especially our amazing community of friends and neighbors who have helped
us get to this point.

## Motivation

We wanted to do this because we wanted to!

## Whats next

Homelessness SOLVED.
