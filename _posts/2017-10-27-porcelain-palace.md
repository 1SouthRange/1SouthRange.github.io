The stock airstream bathroom, designed and built in 1977, feels a little bit
outdated. With the interior walls and toilet removed, its clear that the
plastic molded pieces are actually pretty nice. They don’t look super cool,
but they fit nicely and have pretty useful functionality. Mostly, their
appeal comes from the fact that there’s no way we’re going to do better.
However, they’re a pretty ugly color of aged beige. So we want to transform
this tired space into something more pleasant.

## The paint

Being that we’ll be showering in a pretty small space (it’s going to get
a bit wet) and the plastic is not your normal painting substrate, standard
paint from Home Depot won’t do the trick. A knowledgeable friend recommended
that we use this pretty gnarly stuff called Fiber Glass Duretec. Its used
for boats and RV’s and has a good reputation, but HOLY SMOKES this stuff
is crazy. I’ll try to find the warning list soon because its pretty extensive
and comically scary. Basically, this stuff is cancer and if you smell it
you will go blind.

Anyway, we got it in white.

## The painting

We were told the best application method is spray and since we know nothing
about applying gel coat we went with it. At this point, I should mention "we"
is my brother, Joey, and me... Katie was in Dubai. On December 31, Joey and
I rented an air compressor, discounted Christmas wrapping paper (Joey’s
genius idea), and body suits. We taped masks on the stuff we didn’t want
to gel coat like the windows and the portion of the wall that isn’t plastic
molding. Then, we taped together trash bags to make a curtain to prevent the
spray from going everywhere in the airstream. Finally, we suited up in body
suits and masks and went through a few drills of mixing the three part
solution, filling the spray canister, handing everything off to whoever is
doing the painting, and making a quick egress if needed.

When it came time to paint, everything went wrong. Apparently, spraying
paint is a subtle job. Too much or too little air pressure and things
get hairy. By far the sketchiest part of this attempt was in the vortex
of cancer that we created by sealing off the bathroom section. With no
open windows or exhaust fan to remove the excess spray, the bathroom
quickly filled with gel coat particles making it nearly impossible to
breathe or even hold your eyes open.

After a long day of prep and a long night of trying to paint, Joey and
I got the heck out of there, showered, and welcomed in 2017.

## Juan

Ok, so we can’t spray this gel coat on ourselves. I started making some
phone calls to local painters hoping a pro would have better luck. Juan
David, a super nice man, decided he would take the challenge. Katie and
I carefully removed the bathroom panel pieces from the airstream and I
helped Juan pile them in his truck all the while thinking "This guy has
no idea what he’s gotten himself into."

$300 dollars and a couple of weeks later, we get our bathroom panels back
and Juan couldn’t get rid of them quick enough. Seriously. When we initially
met, he was very sweet and talkative. This time, he simply wanted to deliver
these damn pieces and bounce. I imagine it went only marginally better for
him as he didn’t get very far in painting the pieces either.

Nevertheless, we reinstalled the panels and almost decided to just let
it be so we can move on to something, anything, else.

## Just roll it on

**AS IT TURNS OUT** the gel coat can be very easily rolled on! As a
last resort, Katie and I tried rolling on a little bit of gel coat onto
the tub just to see what happens. It was extremely, extremely easy and
resulted in a very nice and smooth finish. Aside from this chemical being
super toxic and smelly so masks and gloves are absolutely required,
painting it on with rollers and brushes is a breeze and definitely the
way to go if you don’t have a studio to do the spraying.

We prepped the surfaces by sanding down the lumps left by the previous
attempts at spraying. We also spent a good bit of time sanding some rough
patches in the bathtub plastic itself. Then, We applied five or so coats
of Duratec over the next month.

## All in all

In the end, we spent two and half months and nearly $1000 applying gel coat
to the bathroom panels. The result is a nice, seemingly durable and waterproof
finish on the plastic. The white is much more pleasant than the old beige.
I’d call it a general success. However, I don’t think I would easily
agree to use this product again the next time. Duratec seems like a great
coating, but it’s extremely toxic, not easy to work with, and a bit of
overkill for an airstream interior. Furthermore, disposing of excess Duratec
is not as simple as throwing it in the trash can. This stuff should be
treated as hazardous material and disposing of it appropriately is a
challenge in itself.
