I found a quick pic from our earliest adventure with this airstream. The
photo below is the on day we got it.

The sun was in our face so Katie looks extra Asian ðŸ˜‰
It was an interesting drive for both of us since I had very little
experience driving such a big rig and Katie had to be a passenger
through it.

Hereâ€™s some advice to anyone planning on doing this in the future:

- Put everything on the floor. Our refrigerator and microwave fell
  pretty early on and things were flying around all over the place.
- Take your time. We rented a GMC Sierra V8 which had plenty of
  power to pull this trailer, but going over 60 MPH caused a noticeable
  degradation in handling.
- Be safe. I think it was due to the seams in the road between blocks
  of concrete, but our Airstream was prone to pitching oscillations
  which at times was enough to shake the whole truck. In those cases,
  I just let off the gas entirely and let it coast until the
  oscillations stopped. Taking it easy is the name of the game here,
  donâ€™t slam the brakes just let it calm itself.
