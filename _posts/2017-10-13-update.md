Its been awhile, but we’re still doing the thing. We haven’t
updated this blog in about 10 months, but it’s not for lack of want.
Katie and I have been super busy with Airstream renovation and some other
big things. I’ll be working to update this blog as much as possible
to catalog our decisions, adventures, and newfound knowledge.

Talk to you soon!
