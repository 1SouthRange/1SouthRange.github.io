This post is short and sweet just like our patch for the giant
hole we cut out of the floor to diagnose the leaks. Before patching,
I had to stop and take in just how much of the floor we cut out.
Iâ€™ve post this photo before, but its worth showing again.

We decided against replacing the entire floorboards mainly because
they are fastened with very old, rusty screws that are nearly impossible
to remove without grinding. And around this time we had also decided to
use a plywood finished floor which would smooth out any uneven seems
in the subfloor.

So, short story even shorter: there was leak which has rotted a section
of the subfloor but we cut it out and replaced it with fresh plywood.

Here are a couple of more interesting updates:
