## Commitment

A large component of the plan to live in the Airstream has been to
own the land where it’s parked. We knew it would be a challenge to find a
good space as the great millennial generation has found the benefit
of living in an urban setting that was almost forgotten by our
ancestors. When Katie found an 18 ft by 103 ft lot for sale in the St
Roch neighborhood of New Orleans (AKA New Marigny AKA 8th ward AKA
Airbnb’s and rolled ice cream AKA hip as hell) at an affordable
price, we had to jump on it.

On Friday, January 20, we signed the purchase agreement. And since
it was Friday and Fridays are for R Bar, we did it while waiting
in line for the best crawfish in the city.

New Orleans sure is beautiful. And now we’re in a committed partnership.

## Questions of longevity: title insurance

This particular property was purchased by the prior owner through
Civic Source, a service which works with the City of New Orleans to sell
tax delinquent properties. Because this particular property was previously
tax delinquent, its at a higher risk of a dirty title so securing title
insurance was the first challenge. We were initially turned away by two title
insurance agencies, but NOLA Title hooked it up in the end with a specific
insurance for properties in this exact situation.

Come to find out, there are indeed two titles out on this property making
it less than ideal. But hey, that’s why we get insurance, right?

## Put a ring on it

Finally, on April 24 we shelled out the cash and officially purchased a
rectangle of dirt. As is par for the course, the whole process of purchasing
this lot was a long learning experience. Things were much more complicated
and took twice as long as expected.

Little did we know, these were the first steps in a very long and
exhausting journey in owning an undeveloped piece of land. I have admittedly
questioned what were we thinking getting into all of this. But you don’t
know what you don’t know, and often times experience is the best teacher.
