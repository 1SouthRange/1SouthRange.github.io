Over the past few months, Katie and I have been putting
in some serious work into the airstream and no work into this blog.

To the 0 people who actually read this: I’m sorry.

Anyway, here’s what we’ve been up to...

- Purchased a property in the St Roch neighborhood of New Orleans!
- Installed new floors in the airstream
- Coated the bathroom components with the gnarly water proof chemical
- Completed the bed
- And took the airstream to a shop to be resealed

All of these things had their own challenges and I hope to document
that in more detail in the upcoming posts.

Talk to you soon!
