excerpt: and leaked in out Airstream.

Apparently Airstreams do leak so although this is definitely a bummer,
its better to have found out the state of the exterior shell now
rather than after we had moved in.

In any case, after discovering a wet sub-floor near the wall opposite
to the door, we set out investigating the leaks. First, we bought a
circular saw, set it to just under 1/2 inch, and cut a hole out of
the floor where it had first shown signs of moisture exposing the
frame and belly pan. Immediately, it was clear that the water was
getting to that spot from somewhere towards the rear. Next we cut
a whole in the subfloor all the way to the wheel well. It still
wasn’t obvious where the leak was coming in, but it was clear
that it was not coming from above. We ended up taking off the
wheel well and clearing out the exposed insulation. It looks
pretty gross, right?

After peeling off the floor and cleaning up bunch of first in the
belly pan, we found the source of leak! The picture below isn’t
great, but that bright spot is the sunlight from the outside.

It felt like a relief finding this hole as we thought it would be
a breeze to patch it and move on. As the sun was setting this
Saturday, we had a cut a pretty big hole in our floor.

And then it rained some more in New Orleans and we found more leaks.
This time the water was coming from above the subfloor. It became
evident that some of the window seals were saturated and leaking
through. To really diagnose the problem, we removed an interior
panel and took down some more insulation.

Ultimately, we learned that airstreams will leak, caulk needs maintenance,
and getting the hard stuff over with helps the project move forward.
We’re hoping to have this leak fixed and floor patched by the end of
this week so look out for an update in a few days!
