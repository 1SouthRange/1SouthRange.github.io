excerpt: We were doing a bad job of documenting progress so I made an app for that.

Even before we purchased the Airstream, Katie and I talked about documenting
everything we do with it, for it, and to it. Talk was cheap. We drove from
New Orleans to Lafayette to pick it up and took exactly zero pictures
throughout that process, and it was a process.
**Not even one with Warren, the nice man who sold it to us!**

Then, we proceeded to take out 90% of its guts without taking a single
"before" photo. Knowing exactly how Katie and I operate (big ideas,
poor follow through), I decided to combine a few unfinished iPhone app
projects to capture time lapse images of the Airstream while we work.
Surprisingly, after one night and one morning of development, the app
worked well. It does exactly one thing: takes a picture at a given
frequency and saves it to the phone’s photo library. Its pretty
straightforward, but I’m happy with the result.

The photos can then be stitched together into a video or a GIF. In this case,
I used the Python Image Library, PIL, to put the frames into a video.
