After ripping out almost all of the interior and an entire day of scrubbing,
we were ready to coat the vinyl inside of our airstream with primer. I
scanned through quite a few posts on airstream forums and one particular
product kept coming up: XIM primer by Benjamin Moore. This is an oil based
primer that is designed for plastics. We decided to give it a try. It was
a super thin consistency and went on in a thin coat. We used a roller and
a paint brush.
