As mentioned in a previous post, we had been debating how to handle the
floor and decided to go with a plywood floor with
[Breakthrough paint by PPG](https://www.ppgpaints.com/products/breakthrough-50-interiorexterior-satin-waterborne-acrylic).
This ultimately turned out to be the least expensive, most durable,
and most maintainable option. Plus we were excited by the thought of
painting the floor any color we want.

We went for a medium quality plywood:
[Equadorian Sande Plywood from Home Depot](http://www.homedepot.com/p/Sande-Plywood-Common-1-2-in-x-4-ft-x-8-ft-Actual-0-472-in-x-48-in-x-96-in-454532/100017950).
While I measured and cut, Katie was coating the underside and edges of
the plywood sheets with primer just to seal them a little more than
nothing at all. All of this took a really long time with the most
difficult and time consuming part being  measuring and cutting out the
front cap which is a story in itself. Ask us about it some time.

Hereâ€™s a time lapse video of us cutting out and laying down the plywood
floor and another one of us priming the finished floor.
