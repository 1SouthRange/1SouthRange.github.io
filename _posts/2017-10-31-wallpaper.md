The 1970â€™s Airstreams came with this really awesome wall paper
in the bathrooms.

but sadly a previous owner of our Airstream (WARREN?!) painted over it with
a dull brown. Katie tried sanding off the brown paint while preserving the
wall paper, but no success.

In any case, we were able to keep atleast one small, untouched patch of
wall paper. Do you know of a wall paper printing company that could do a
custom print at a reasonable cost? Let me know!
I would consider printing in large quantities to meet a minimum.
