For a few months, we‚Äôve had a partially finished bathroom. Well, I‚Äôm on a
mission to change that. This weekend I set out to install our AirHead
composting toilet and wire our Suburban water heater. As usual, it
wasn‚Äôt easy. But almost success.

## Water Heater

We have a gas/electric 10 gallon water heater. It was partially installed
last summer when we dropped the airstream off at Stepper RV for some repairs.
However, contrary to the advice of Stepper‚Äôs most wise owner, Michelle,
I decided to save the cash and wire the water heater myself. Stepper only
put the water heater in the exterior hole and sealed it. While towing the
Airstream away from Stepper, the tail end was wagging all over the place
and the water heater basically uninstalled itself. Luckily, it didn‚Äôt fall
out onto the Crescent City Connection!

We lost the owners manual between both of us moving so I spent some time
finding a copy online and trying to read it on my phone. It says that
securing the water heater to the airstream should be accomplished by
fastening the exterior frame to a frame in the Airstream opening. This
is when it hits me... I threw 2/3 of that bit away when I remove the
old water heater üôÅWell, this thing isn‚Äôt moving anywhere so we are going
to have to deal with only one side of the water heater fastened.

Ok, now to the electrical connection. Conveniently, we have both DC and AC
wires available near the water heater. After wiring the DC circuit, I flip
the switch and hear a buzz so I quickly flip it off thinking I might blow
the circuit. After a few hours of sketchy electrical connections and
debugging, I‚Äôm hopelessly confused and give up for the day. The
following day, Michelle at Stepper gives me some much needed confidence:
just wire both the AC and DC circuits and the noise should stop in a
few minutes. Cool. So after thinking on this problem all night, a phone
call and an hour‚Äôs worth of trying again got us much cleaner electrical
connections and hot water!

## Composting toilet

This one wasn‚Äôt too bad now that I have my OCD in check and have moved
well into ‚Äúlet‚Äôs get this done‚Äù mode.

Drilled a hole in the floor, fastened the exhaust fan, wired it to a
switch. Drilled another few holes and fastened the toilet to the floor.
Boom. Boom. Boom. Almost done.

### To do:

- Glue the exhaust fan housing on the toilet body with plumbers pvc glue
- Install the insect screen in the exhaust tube
- Shorten the exhaust tube
- Screw the exhaust tube into the toilet and the exhaust fan housing
- Use it!

## Looking forward

Both of these projects depend on the walls underneath the bathroom
sink for their final installation. This is getting to the fun part.
Katie has finished building our bathroom partitions so we are getting
really close to putting up some walls and finishing the details of the
bathroom. We are both excited about it since this will really make the
space more livable and cut down on the amount of the airstream that
feels unfinished.

Hanging out in there in the middle of a spring day in New Orleans was
great. It‚Äôs really a beautiful space and the foliage around our property
plus Katie‚Äôs gate give the feeling of a private hideaway. This deserves
its own post, but thanks to these and other amazing friends who helped
make our space what it is!
